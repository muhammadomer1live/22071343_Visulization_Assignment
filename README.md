Infographics Project - Tell a story using data

Choose data from World BankLinks to an external site., kaggleLinks to an external site., EarthDataLinks to an external site., EurostatLinks to an external site., International Monetary FundLinks to an external site., datahub.ioLinks to an external site., UCI ML RepositoryLinks to an external site., World Health OrganisationLinks to an external site., British Film InstituteLinks to an external site., data.gov.ukLinks to an external site., ukdataservice.ac.ukLinks to an external site., or any other data sources. Use Google search for dashboard and infographics for an inspiration. Here are some ideas:
Climate change and its effects on agriculture, migration, change of ecosystems
Economic development, poverty, education, human right status in different countries and regions, different age groups and genders
Military conflicts and military expenditure, human casualties
Diseases and pandemics, their severity and casualties
Trends in travel and public transport
Sport insights for performance of leagues, teams or players.
Use numpy and pandas to compute summary statistics of the data
Use matplotlib and seaborn libraries to produce visualisations of your data and your summary statistics
Infographics requirements:

Infographics must have a title and the student's name and ID number on it.
Infographics should have 4 or more plots or equivalent visualisation elements:
All plots must be sensible and easy to understand:
It should take no more than 5 seconds to understand each plot and no more than 20 seconds to understand the visualisation.
If you have more that 4 plots, write in the Canvas comments section which plots should treated as a single group.
All labels should be clearly visible: non-overlapping and good sized, easy to read in full-screen mode.
Each plot should provide new information not available in other plots. (Plots that provide information already shown in other plots will result in 0 grade.)
All plots together should be semantically connected and complement each other thus making a single story.
Infographics must include texts explaining the main message of the visualisation and of each individual plot:
Explanations should be short, straight to the point.
Explanations should not repeat what is already written on the visualisation:
e.g., "this plot shows population growth of the UK" is not a good explanation.
e.g., "17.5% increase in 30 years" is a good explanation.
Recommendations:
Focus on trends and summary statistics.
Avoid scatterplots, heatmaps, correlation matrices and similar visualisation styles.
